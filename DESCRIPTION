Description: Cobb's maximum likelihood method for cusp-catastrophe modeling
        (Grasman, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v032.i08>;
        Cobb (1981), Behavioral Science, 26(1), 75-78). Includes a cusp() function for model 
        fitting, and several utility functions for plotting, and for comparing the
        model to linear regression and logistic curve models.
